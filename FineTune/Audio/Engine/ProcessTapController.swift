// MARK: - Threading Model
//
// ProcessTapController bridges two execution domains:
//
// 1. **Main thread / @MainActor**: All setup, teardown, and state management.
//    - activate(), invalidate(), updateDevices(), performCrossfadeSwitch()
//    - Property writes to nonisolated(unsafe) vars (_volume, _isMuted, etc.)
//    - The class is @MainActor; the HAL callback is explicitly nonisolated.
//
// 2. **HAL I/O thread (real-time)**: Audio processing callback.
//    - processAudioCallback() — unified callback with runtime role via callbackID
//    - Reads nonisolated(unsafe) vars; writes _peakLevel/_secondaryPeakLevel,
//      _primaryCurrentVolume/_secondaryCurrentVolume, _lastRenderHostTime, _hasRenderedAudio
//    - MUST NOT allocate, lock, log, or call ObjC. See .claude/rules/rt-safety.md
//
// The nonisolated(unsafe) annotation marks variables that cross the thread boundary.
// Aligned Float32/Bool/Int reads/writes are atomic on Apple ARM64/x86-64.
